Recursive Temporal queries use a restriction of time points as infinite reasoning is currrently not implemented.
The restriction is also currently targeted in such a range that for the smallest example we get at least some result in an accetable time.
This has to be removed at later steps, when the implementation is fully supporting infinite reasoning, at the moment such programs would not terminate.
